This page shows Sentinel-2 composite images for the each of the reefs of the Coral Sea. These show extracts of the draft imagery of the **CS_AIMS-Sentinel-2-marine_V0** dataset. This imagery is false colour that is based on the ultraviolet (B1), blue (B2) and green (B3) Sentinel 2 image channels. These images focus on highlighting deep features (up to 60 m) and thus are over exposed in shallow areas. Note: The ground resolution of each image is different as the resolution of the images is fixed, but the area shown varies.
